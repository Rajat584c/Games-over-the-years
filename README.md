This project dives into a massive dataset of 474,000+ video games, exploring how the gaming industry has evolved over the years. From release trends and genre mashups to ESRB ratings and critical reviews, the analysis paints a clear picture of where the gaming world stands today and where it’s headed.

Our work focuses on:

* Cleaning and transforming messy raw data into usable insights.

* Identifying market trends across genres, ratings, and audiences.

* Building an interactive dashboard for decision-making.
